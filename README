Maze walk mini game

Michał Szymański, 2018

To run the game, type:
  python3 run.py

The game has three different maze generators built-in. Depth-First Search
generator is the hardest, Breadth-First is easier, Horizontal Passage
is the easiest. Pick one and start exploring. Your goal is to find a way
out of the maze. The exit is at the bottom and you start at the top.

Good luck!
